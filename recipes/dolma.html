    <h1>Step 1: Prepare the Grape Leaves</h1>
    <p>
      We're using jarred grape leaves in brine, no cooking needed. But before
      using in this recipe, remove them from the jar and rinse well. Let them
      drain in a colander while you prepare the stuffing.
    </p>

    <h1>Step 2: Prepare the Stuffing</h1>
    <p>
      The stuffing here is made of rice, cooked ground beef, and a few chopped
      fresh herbs (parsley, dill, and mint). First, rinse the rice and soak in
      water for 20 minutes (this is an important step, read on for more tips.)
      Then drain well. And while the rice is soaking cook the meat. Sautee
      finely chopped onions, add the meat and cook until fully browned. Be sure
      to drain any excess fat, then season the meat with kosher salt and pepper,
      allspice and cumin (so tasty!) Let cool. Cooked ground beef for stuffed
      grape leaves Combine the meat, rice, and fresh herbs. Add a generous
      drizzle of extra virgin olive oil (I used Private Reserve Greek EVOO) and
      toss to combine. Add pinch of kosher salt. Stuffing for grape leaves.

    <h1>Step 3: Stuff and Roll Grape Leaves</h1>
    <p>
      I like to start by preparing my cooking pot so that I can arrange the
      grape leaves as I stuff them. Lightly oil the pot with some extra virgin
      olive oil, then add a few layers of grape leaves and top with sliced
      tomatoes. This protects the stuffed grape leaves touching the bottom of
      the pot from scorching. Cooking pot with sliced tomatoes on top of layer
      of open grape leaves To stuff grape leaves, work one leaf at a time. Lay
      the leaf flat on a cutting board with the more textured side facing you.
      Cut off the stem. Take a heaping teaspoon of the rice stuffing mixture (a
      little bit less than 1 tablespoon) and place in the center of the leaf
      (close to where stem was). One grape leaf on cutting board with rice
      stuffing in middle Fold the sides over the filling and roll, keep tucking
      the left and right sides as you roll (think of this like you're rolling
      spring rolls or cigars.) Grape leaf stuffed and rolled Fold and roll grape
      leaves tightly enough but not too tight so the rice has room to expand as
      it cooks. A few fully rolled stuffed grape leaves on cutting board

    <h1>Step 4: Assemble Grape Leaves in Cooking Pot</h1>
    <p>
      Neatly arrange the grape leaves in rows, seam-side down, in your prepared
      pot, covering the circumference of the pot. Uncooked stuffed grape leaves
      assembled in cooking pots Then place a small plate inverted on top (this
      helps keep them in place while cooking.) Boil the water or broth and pour
      over the grape leaves, arriving at the top layer and somewhat covering
      (about 4 cups liquid, maybe a little more.) An inverted small plate is
      added on top of the assembled grape leaves
    </p>
    <h1>Step 5: Cook Grape Leaves on Stovetop</h1>
    <p>
      Cover the pot with its lid and cook over medium heat for 30 minutes until
      the liquid has been absorbed. Uncover and remove the plate, then pour
      juice of 2 lemons. Cover again with the lid (no need for the plate at this
      point), cook on low heat for 30 to 45 more minutes or until fully cooked.
      Let rest for 20 to 30 minutes, uncovered, before transferring to serving
      platter.
